# Introduction: TimeVQVAE
This is an official Github repository for the PyTorch implementation of TimeVQVAE from the paper ["Vector Quantized Time Series Modeling with a Bidirectional Prior Model", AISTATS 2023]. 
TimeVQVAE is a robust time series generation model that utilizes vector quantization for data compression and a bidirectional transformer model for the prior learning.
