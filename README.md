# TimeVQVAE
This is an official Github repository for the PyTorch implementation of TimeVQVAE from the paper ["Vector Quantized Time Series Modeling with a Bidirectional Prior Model", AISTATS 2023].

TimeVQVAE is a robust time series generation model that utilizes vector quantization for data compression into the discrete latent space (stage1) and a bidirectional transformer for the prior learning (stage2).
